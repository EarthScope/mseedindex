	- Update documentation.

2023.188:
	- Fix the addition of strings in the JSON output.

2023.180:
	- Re-organize JSON output schema.
	- Calculate SHA-256 for all read per-file data, include in JSON output.

	- When input is stdin, set "mod time" to 0, do not include in JSON.
	- Update to libmseed 3.0.15 and embedded yyjson library.
	- Update to sqlite 3.40.1.

2022.200:

	- Allow reading from stdin when input file is "-".
	- Fix logic error wth inconsistent record lengths.

2022.172:
	- Complete porting to libmseed 3.
	NOTE: Data quality indicators are no longer tracked and have
	been replaced with version numbers for consistency.
	No database schema change is needed as the schema already
	includes fields for both quality and version.

2022.160:
	- Update libmseed to v3.0.11.
	- Invert the logic of WITHOUTPOSTGRESQL -> WITHPOSTGRESQL,
	Default build is without PostgreSQL support and it must be
	enabled if desired.

2019.122:
	- Add setup.py to allow pushing a installer package to PyPi.

2018.163: 2.7.1

	which is unpopulated by this version of the software but will
	be populated in the future.

2017.283: 2.6
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.5, with fix for leap second calculation.

2017.201: 2.5
	- Update logic that identifies and replaces index rows for the same
	or versioned file names to match the data time coverage +- 1 day.
	Otherwise, replacement of files containing no overlap data did not
	work correctly.

2017.123: 2.4
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.4.
	- Update SQLite to 3.18.0.
	- Add 'PRAGMA case_sensitive_like = ON' for SQLite synchronization.
	This means that the LIKE queries are performed case sensitive as
	they should be for the program usage with the filename column.
	Importantly, this allows the LIKE matching to use the column index.

2017.071: 2.3
	- Add -noup (no updates) option to refrain from searching for and
	deleting existing rows in the database.
	- Remove double quotes from keys and values of timeindex field
	in SQLite representation.

	- Combine SQLite indexes for more efficient use.
	
2017.068:
	- Add -sqlitebusyto option to allow changes to the SQLite busy
	timeout value.
	- Make -table argument optional and use default of 'tsindex'.

	multi-process access to the database (e.g. parallel usage).
	- Set HAVE_USLEEP=1 for SQLite build to allow timeout loops to
	iterate with sub-second intervals.

2017.062: 2.0
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.2.
	- Update sqlite to 3.17.
	- Update to table definition with timerates and format fields, hereby
	known as schema version 1.0.
	- Update doc/database-schema.txt to version 1.0 and generalize.
	- Change default database name from iris to timeseries.

2016.314: 1.9
	- Update libmseed to 2.18.
	- Update sqlite to 3.15.
	- Change license to LGPLv3 and add LICENSE.txt.
	- Add doc/mseedindex.md, a translation of the man page to markdown.

2016.255: 1.8
	- Require -table argument and one of either -pghost or -sqlite.
	- Add capabilty to synchronize with SQLite3 databases.
	- Refactor internals for reduced mixing of database interactions.
	- Allow building without PostgreSQL support by setting WITHOUTPOSTGRESQL.

2016.169: 1.7
	- Add extent time range for the queries that search for and delete rows
	based on filename.  The time range criteria can be used by the database
	for more efficient searching.

2015.122: 1.6
	- Update libmseed to 2.16.
	- Database schema change: replace timerange field with starttime,endtime
	- Resolve absolute paths for input files and store them by default.  A new
	command line option of '-kp' can be used to keep the original paths.

2015.088: 1.5
	- Increase maximum size of buffer allowed for the string representation
	of the time spans (4 MiB to 8 MiB). Sufficient for 200,000+ spans.

2015.086: 1.4
	- Increase maximum size of buffers allowed for the string representation
	of the time index (1 KB to 4 KB) and time spans (1 MiB to 4 MiB).

2105.082: 1.3
	- Fix logic of tracking next time index boundary to guarantee that the
	index time and offset are only increasing.

2015.078: 1.2
	- Separate file reading and database synchronization into different loops.
	- Only connect to the database after all input files have been read.
	This avoids holding a database connection open while data files are read
	and reduces the connection time needed.

2015.071: 1.1
	- Update libmseed to 2.15.
	- Reset previous file position for each file.
	- Track whether records in a data section are in time order and set
	a 'latest' flag in the time index based on ordering.  If the records
	are in time order then the index also indicates the byte offest of the
	latest timed data.

2015.062: 1.0
	- Update libmseed to 2.14.
	- Read leap second list file from /opt/dmc/share/leap-seconds.list

2015.060: 0.91
	- Set data section update time to file modification time instead of
	the scan time when not retaining an existing entry.

2015.059: 0.9
	- Rework logic to track all conterminous records with the same NSLCQ
	as a section regardless of time order, each section will be exactly
	one row in the database.
	- Add time span tracking for each contiguous NSLCQ section in file,
	store as array of numrange values (epoch times) in 'timespans' field.
	Data with a sample rate of zero is not included in the time span list.
	- Remove tracking of segment count and gap seconds as these do not
	work properly when data is not in time order.
	- Set time index to NULL when the earliest data in a given section is
	not represented in the index.  It would not be usable to indentify
	a contiguous read range including all data.

2015.057:
	- Rename to mseedindex from mseedsyncdb.

2015.037: 0.8
	- Fix printing error, print int32_t segments as %d insted of %lld.

2015.037: 0.7
	- Store file modification time in new filemodtime field.
	- Improve failure handling on memory allocation errors.

2015.035: 0.6
	- Track time indexing within a segment at one hour intervals and
	store indexing in a new hstore field.

2014.288: 0.5
	- Update to new schema using separate network, station, location,
	channel, quality as character fields instead of nslcq ltree.

2014.281: 0.4
	- Group conterminuous NSLCQ records in a file and track number of
	continuous segments and total gap (non-coverage) for each group.
	- Update to new schema supporting the segment count and gap value.

	- Update to new schema using fields:
	  * nslcq (ltree type for Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual)
	  * timerange (tstzrange type for inclusive start-end range)
	- Add the following options:
	  * -table: specify target table name, default is 'timeseries'
	  * -dbhost: specify database host, default dbserv3
	  * -dbport: specify database port, default 5444
	  * -dbuser: specify database user name, default timeseries
	  * -dbpass: specify database user password, default timeseries

	- Add segment (trace) listing to verbose output.

2013.014: 0.1
