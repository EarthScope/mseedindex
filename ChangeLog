2015.062: 1.0
	- Update libmseed to 2.14.
	- Read leap second list file from /opt/dmc/share/leap-seconds.list

2015.060: 0.91
	- Set data section update time to file modification time instead of
	the scan time when not retaining an existing entry.

2015.059: 0.9
	- Rework logic to track all conterminous records with the same NSLCQ
	as a section regardless of time order, each section will be exactly
	one row in the database.
	- Add time span tracking for each contiguous NSLCQ section in file,
	store as array of numrange values (epoch times) in 'timespans' field.
	Data with a sample rate of zero is not included in the time span list.
	- Remove tracking of segment count and gap seconds as these do not
	work properly when data is not in time order.
	- Set time index to NULL when the earliest data in a given section is
	not represented in the index.  It would not be usable to indentify
	a contiguous read range including all data.

2015.057:
	- Rename to mseedindex from mseedsyncdb.

2015.037: 0.8
	- Fix printing error, print int32_t segments as %d insted of %lld.

2015.037: 0.7
	- Store file modification time in new filemodtime field.
	- Improve failure handling on memory allocation errors.

2015.035: 0.6
	- Track time indexing within a segment at one hour intervals and
	store indexing in a new hstore field.

2014.288: 0.5
	- Update to new schema using separate network, station, location,
	channel, quality as character fields instead of nslcq ltree.

2014.281: 0.4
	- Group conterminuous NSLCQ records in a file and track number of
	continuous segments and total gap (non-coverage) for each group.
	- Update to new schema supporting the segment count and gap value.

2014.279: 0.3
	- Update to new schema using fields:
	  * nslcq (ltree type for Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual)
	  * timerange (tstzrange type for inclusive start-end range)
	- Add the following options:
	  * -table: specify target table name, default is 'timeseries'
	  * -dbhost: specify database host, default dbserv3
	  * -dbport: specify database port, default 5444
	  * -dbuser: specify database user name, default timeseries
	  * -dbpass: specify database user password, default timeseries

2014.260:
	- Update libmseed to 2.13.
	- Rearrange src/Makefile to tidy it up and avoid LDFLAGS collision.

2013.308: 0.2
