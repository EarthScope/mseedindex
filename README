mseedsyncdb - Synchronize Mini-SEED with database schema


-- Building/Installing --

In most environments a simple 'make' will build the program.

The CC and CFLAGS environment variables can be used to configure
the build parameters.

Using GCC, running 'make static' will compile a static version
if possible.

For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.
